# Usage: image2card imagefile "full name"
#
# Requires `convert' from ImageMagick.
# Read image, convert to PNG, forcing a 40x40 size and encode
# to BASE64. Create a JSON payload to be published to
# owntracks/username/device/info
#
# You probably want to do this:
#
# image2card.sh filename.jpg "Jane Jolie" > card.json
# mosquitto_pub -t owntracks/jane/phone/info -f card.json -r
#
# Note: the two commands cannot be piplelined (mosquitto_pub -l)
# because of a bug in mosquitto_pub:
#  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=478917
# If you have a newish version it should work fine.
