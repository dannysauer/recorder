# Usage: github2card username
#
# Read the Github profile of `username' and obtain user's
# name and avatar_url to create a CARD JSON payload to
# be published retained to owntracks/username/device/info
#
# You probably want to do this:
#
# github2card.py jjolie > card.json
# mosquitto_pub -t owntracks/jane/phone/info -r -f card.json
#
# Note: the two commands cannot be piplelined (mosquitto_pub -l)
# because of a bug in mosquitto_pub:
#  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=478917
# If you have a newer version it should work fine.
